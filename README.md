# Instacart Analysis
This is my look at The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset from 2017. 
I started with cleaning the data, getting columns in the right data type and inserting foreign keys where they were missing. 
I calculated the date of each order working backwards from each users most recent order date and the days since previous order. 
I joined all 8 tables together into one massive overview table that contained all of the information so I could export it to Tableau to finish my analysis and make data visualizations.
